/*1: Guess The Number
Write a program that will generate a number between 1 and 100. Your program will ask the user to guess the generated number.When the user types a guess, the program should tell them if they won (the guess matched the computer's number), if their guess was higher than the number the computer generated, OR if the guess was lower than the number the computer generated. Terminate the program if the user types "exit". */

/*Scrabble (the game in which players remove tiles with letters on them from a bag and use them to create words on the game board) has a set number of 100 tiles.

This number does not change between games, nor does the frequency of each letter.

Frequency and point value of each tile.

Represent each tile by the letter that appears on it, and blank tiles by underscores (_).

Input:

An uppercase string with the tiles that have already been played.

E.g., if 14 tiles have been played, you would be given an input like this:

AERETOXMYCNS_B

Output:

10: E
9: I
8: A
7: O
5: R, N, T
4: U, L, D
3: G, S
2: P, H, F, V, W
1: B, Y, J, K, M, Q, C, Z, _
0: X */
