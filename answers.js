1: Guess The Number

Write a program that will generate a number between 1 and 100. Your program will
 ask the user to guess the generated number.

When the user types a guess, the program should tell them if they won (the guess
   matched the computer's number), if their guess was higher than the number the computer generated, OR if the guess was lower than the number the computer generated. Terminate the program if the user types "exit".
